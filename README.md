#Weather station#
============

Final project on secondary school, meteorological/weather station with web access.

## Divided into two main parts:
* Sensors with MCU outside, collecting various values
* Software running on RaspberryPi, grabs values from sensor "module",
    stores them in mysql database and publishes them on web.

## Material here :

* In **multi_sens** directory are complete sources for sensor module with libraries (some of them are not used anymore)
  can be build with avr-gcc (tested on (arch)linux with 4.7.2).

* In **root** is simple python script. Periodicaly executed by cron (every 1O mins and 1min). After execution sends request to sensor
  module (serial communication), returned structured string is decoded into mesured values. Then script stores values
  into mysql database for further usage and requests some last values. From returned values is generated javascript file
  containing array fileled with values. (used by web page)
  Data from minute updates are used for webpage header only. The are not stored for further usage.

* In **web_app** is web application's root, so index.html and value file(s) generated by script described above are here.

* In **electonics** are schematics, PSB designs, their exports for printing, etc.

* In **designs** are models of housing for sensor module now, openscad source and stls of individual parts

## STATUS
* working, needs webpage design improvement
* look at: http://m52.dkm.cz
