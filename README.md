wthr_station
============

Final project on secondary school, meteorologic station with web access.

Can be divided into two main parts:

  -Sensors with MCU outside, collecting various values
  -Software running on RaspberryPi, grabs values from sensor "module",
    stores them in mysql database and puhblishs them onto webpage.

Material here :

  In multi_sens directory are complete sources for sensor module with libraries (some of them are not used anymore)
  can be build with avr-gcc (tested on (arch)linux with 4.7.2).

  In root is simple python script. Periodicaly executed by cron (every 1O mins). After execution sends request to sensor
  module (serial communication), returned structured string is decoded into mesured values. Then script stores values
  into mysql database for further usage and requests some last values. From returned values is generated javascript file
  containing array fileled with values. (used by web page)

  In web_app is web application's root, so index.html a other common files are here, yui library should be here too
  (download it by yourself ;-) and value file(s) generated by script described above.
